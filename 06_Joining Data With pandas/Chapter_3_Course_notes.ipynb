    "### Filtering joins\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have only worked with mutating joins, which combines data from two tables. However, filtering joins filter observations from one table based on whether or not they match an observation in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutating joins:**\n",
    "    * Combines data from two tables based on matching observations in both tables.\n",
    "- **Filtering joins:**\n",
    "    * Filter observations from tables based on whether or not they match an observation in another table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Semi-join\n",
    "\n",
    "A semi join filters the left table down to those observations that have a match in the right table. It is smiliar to an inner join where only the intersection between the tables is returned, but unlike an inner join, only the columns from the left table are shown. Finally, no duplicate rows from the left table are returned, even if there is a one-to-many relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this new dataset, we have table of song genres shown here. There's also a table of top-rated song tracks. The 'gid' column connects the two tables. Let's say we want to find what genres appear in our table of top songs. A semijoin would return only the columns from the genre table and not the tracks.\n",
    "<img src='pictures\\Example_datasets.png' alt=example dataset/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1 (semi-join)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's merge the two tables with an inner join. We also print the first few rows of the genres_tracks variable. Since this is an inner join, the returned 'gid' column holds only values where both tables matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "genres_tracks = genres.merge(top_tracks, on='gid')\n",
    "genres_tracks.head()\n",
    "```\n",
    "<img src='pictures\\Step_1_semi_join.png' alt=Step_1 />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next step in the technique, let's focus on this line of code. It uses a method called **isin()**, which compares every **'gid'** in the genres table to the **'gid'** in the **genres_tracks** table. This will tell us if our genre appears in our merged genres_tracks table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "genres['gid'].isin(genres_tracks['gid'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "<img src='pictures\\Step_2.png' alt=step_2 />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine everything, we use that line of code to subset the genres table. The results are saved to top_genres and we print a few rows. We've completed a semi join. These are rows in the genre table that are also found in the top_tracks table. This is called a filtering join because we've filtered the genres table by what's in the top_tracks table\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "genres_tracks = genres.merge(top_tracks, on='gid')\n",
    "top_genres = genres[genres['gid'].isin(genres_tracks['gid'])]\n",

    "### Anti-join\n",
    "\n",
    "Anti-join returns the observations in the left table that do not have a matching observation in the right table. It also only returns the columns from the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anti join:**\n",
    "    * Returns the left table, excluding the intersection\n",
    "    * Returns only columns from the left table and **not** the right\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look go back to our example. Instead of finding the top genres, lets find which genres are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1 (anti-join)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to use a **left join** returning all of the rows from the left table. Here we'll use the **indicator argument** and set it to **True**. With indicator set to True, the merge method adds a column called **\"_merge\"** to the output. This column tells the source of each row. For example, the first four rows found a match in both tables, whereas the last can only be found in the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "genres_tracks = genres.merge(top_tracks, on='gid', how='left', indicator=True)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures\\Anti_join_1.png' alt=anti_join />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the **\"loc\"** accessor and **\"_merge\" column** to select the rows that only appeared in the left table and return only the **\"gid\"** column from the **genres_tracks** table. We now have a list of gids not in the tracks table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gid_list = genres_tracks.loc[genres_tracks['merge'] == 'left_only', 'gid']\n",
    "gid_list.head()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures\\Anti_join_Step_2.png' alt=step_2 />\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In our final step we use the **isin() method** to filter for the rows with **gids** in our **gid_list**. Our output shows those genres not in the tracks table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "genres_tracks = genres.merge(top_tracks, on='gid', how='left', indicator=True)\n",
    "gid_list = genres_tracks.loc[genres_tracks['gid'] == 'left_only', 'gid']\n",
    "non_top_genres = genres.[genres['gid'].isin(gid_list)]\n",

    "\n",
    "What if we need to combine tables that have different column names? The concat method by default will include all of the columns in the different tables it's combining. The sort argument, if true, will alphabetically sort the different column names in the result. If we only want the matching columns between tables, we set the join argument to \"inner\". Its default value is equal to \"outer\", which is why concat by default will include all of the columns. Additionally, the sort argument has no effect when join equals \"inner\". The order of the columns will be the same as the input tables.\n",
