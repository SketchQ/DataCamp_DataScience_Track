    "## Using Seaborn styles\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right type of plot is only the first step in creating effective visualizations.Its also important to configure the other aspects of your visualizations such as;\n",
    "\n",
    "* layouts\n",
    "* labels\n",
    "* colors\n",
    "\n",
    "These traits are referred to as the visualizations's aesthetics. Seaborn has many functions for configuring your plots so they have the most impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn has several default built in themes that are more appealing than the default matplotlib styles. In order to set a default theme, use the ```sns.set()``` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Seaborn has default configurations that can be applied with sns.set()\n",
    "* These styles can override matplotlib and pandas plot as well\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.set()\n",
    "df['Tuition'].plot.hist()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures/snsstyle.jpg' />\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we can look at the distrubition of college tuition fees in the US. The first image shows the standart pandas histogram and the second plot shows what the histogram looks like with Seaborn's style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Color palette is muted and the grid lines are displayed. This is the default Seaborn style, also called darkgrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theme examples with sns.set_style()\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the visualizations, one style may be more beneficial than others for conveying your message. The best approach is to experiment with the styles and use the one that works best for your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for style in ['white', 'dark', 'whitegrid', 'darkgrid', 'ticks'] :\n",
    "    sns.set_style(style)\n",
    "    sns.displot(df['Tuition'])\n",

    "### Removing axes with despine()\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, visualizations are more impactful if the amount of excess *\"chart junk\"* is removed. A common use case is to remove the lines around the axes called spines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn ```despine()``` function removes one or more of the spines on a chart. The default is to remove the top and right lines but more can be removed by passing arguments to the ```despine()``` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.set_style('white')\n",

    "\n",
    "Color is an extremely important component in creating effective visualizations. Different types of data can be interpreded more effectively by using the correct color palettes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn has several function for creating, viewing, and configuring color palettes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a color for a plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Since *Seaborn* is built on top of *matplotlib*, it is able to interpret and apply matplotlib color codes. By using the familiar ```sns.set()``` function with ```color codes``` equals ```True```, any matplotlib color codes will be appropriately mapped to the Seaborn palette. Here is an example of plotting our ```displot()``` using ```'g'``` for green.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We can assing specific colors to a plot. However, this can be tedious when there are many items that must be encoded with color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn makes this task much easier by allowing us to set a palette of color that can be cycled through in a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Seaborn uses the set_palette() function to define a palette\n",

    "\n",

    "#### Further Customizations\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ```axes``` object supports many common customizations\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to setting an x-label, I have also changed the y-label and set a limit so that tuition ranges are only between 0 and $50,000. Finally, I added a title.\n",

    "This example illustrates how you can combine and customize multiple Seaborn plots.\n",
