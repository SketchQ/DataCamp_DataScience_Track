    "For this question we'll use data from the National Survey of Family Growth, which is available from the National Center for Health Statistics. The 2013-2015 dataset includes information about a representative sample of women in the U.S. and their children.\n",

    "``head()`` shows the first 5 rows of the DataFrame, which contains one row for each pregnancy for each of the women who participated in the survey, and one column for each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Columns and rows\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame has an *attribute* called ``.shape``, which is the number of rows and columns; there are *9358* rows in this dataset, one for each pregnancy, and *10* columns, one for each variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame also has an attribute called ```columns```, which is an Index. That's another Pandas data structure, similar to a list; in this case it's a list of variables names, which are strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures/birthweight.jpg' />\n",

    "This figure shows an entry from the codebook for ``birthwgt_lb1``, which is the weight in pounds of the first baby from this pregnancy, for cases of live birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Each Column is a Series\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways a DataFrame is like a Python dictionary, where the variable names are the keys and the columns are the values. You can select a column from a DataFrame using the bracket``[]`` operator, with a *string* as the key. The result is a ``Series``, which is another Pandas data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "``.head()`` shows the first five values in the *series*, the **name** of the series, and the **datatype**; ``float64`` means that these values are 64-bit floating-point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "``NaN``, which stands for *\"Not a Number\"*. ``NaN`` is a special value that can indicate invalid or missing data. "
