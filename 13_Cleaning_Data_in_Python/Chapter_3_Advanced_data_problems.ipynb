    "\n",
    "* uniformatiy\n",
    "* Cross field validation\n",
    "* Dealing with missing data\n",
    "\n",

    "| **Column** | **Unit** |\n",
    "|--------|------|\n",
    "| Temperature | ``32C`` **is also** ``89.7F`` |\n",
    "| Weight | ``70 kg`` **is also** ``11 st`` |\n",
    "| Data | ``26-11-2019`` **is also** ``26, Novemer, 2019`` |\n",
    "| Money | ``100$`` **is also** ``10763,90 Yen`` |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temperatures = pd.read_csv('temperature.csv')   \n",
    "temperatures.head()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures/temperature.jpg' />\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a dataset with average temperature data throughout the month of March in New York City. The dataset was collected from different sources with temperature data in Celsius and Fahrenheit merged together. We can see that unless a major climate event occurred, the final value (``62.6``)here is most likely Fahrenheit, not Celsius. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's confirm the presence of these values visually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import matplotlib\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "# Create scatter plot\n",
    "plt.scatter(x= 'Date', y= 'Temperature', data= temperatures)\n",
    "# Create title, xlabel and ylabel\n",
    "plt.title('Temperature in Celsius March 2019 - NYC')\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Dates')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Temperature in Celsius')\n",
    "# Show plot\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures/temperature1.jpg' />\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice these values here? They all must be fahrenheit!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Treating temperature data\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple web search returns the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius. To convert our temperature data, we isolate all rows of ``temperature`` column where it is above **40** using the ``.loc()`` method. We chose **40** because it's a common sense maximum for Celsius temperatures in New York City. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then convert these values to Celsius using the formula, and reassign them to their respective Fahrenheit values in temperatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make sure that our conversion was correct with an ``assert`` statement, by making sure the maximum value of temperature is less than **40**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temp_fh = temperatures.loc[temperatures['Temperature'] > 40, 'Temperature']\n",
    "temp_cels = (temp_fh - 32) * (5/9)\n",
    "temperatures.loc[temperatures['Temperature'] > 40, 'Temperature'] = temp_cels\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assert conversion is correct\n",
    "assert temperatures['Temperature'].max() < 40\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Treating date data\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another common uniformity problem with date data. This is a DataFrame called birthdays containing birth dates for a variety of individuals. It has been collected from a variety of sources and merged into one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "birthdays.head()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures/birthdays.jpg' />\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the dates here? The one in blue has the month, day, year format, whereas the one in orange has the month written out. The one in red is obviously an error, with what looks like a day day year format. We'll learn how to deal with that one as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datetime Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "``datetime`` is useful for representing dates\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Date** | **datetime format** |\n",
    "|------|-----------------|\n",
    "| 25-12-2019 | ``%d-%m-%Y`` |\n",
    "| December 25th 2019 | ``%c`` |\n",
    "| 12-25-2019 | ``%m-%d-%Y`` |\n",
    "|... | .... |\n",
    "\n",
    "``pandas.to_datetime()`` :\n",
    "* Can recognize most formats automatically\n",
    "* Sometimes fails with erroneous or unrecognazable formats\n",
    "\n",
    "You can treat these date inconsistencies easily by converting your date column to ``datetime``. We can do this in *pandas* with the ``.to_datetime()`` function. However this isn't enough and will most likely return an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Converts to datetime - but wont work!\n",
    "birthdays['Birthday'] = pd.to_datetime(birthdays['birthday'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "since we have dates in multiple formats, especially the weird *day/day/format* which triggers an error with months. Instead we set the ``infer_datetime_format`` argument to ``True``, and set ``errors=coerce``. This will infer the format and return missing value for dates that couldn't be identified and converted instead of a value error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Will Work!\n",
    "birthdays['Birthday'] = pd.to_datetime(birthdays['Birthday'],\n",
    "                                        # Attempt to infer format of each date\n",
    "                                        infer_datetime_format=True,\n",
    "                                        # Returns NA for rows where conversion failed\n",
    "                                         errors='coerce')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This returns the birthday column with aligned formats, with the initial ambiguous format of *day day year*, being set to *NAT*, which represents missing values in *Pandas* for *datetime* objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also convert the format of a datetime column using the ``dt.strftime()`` method, which accepts a datetime format of your choice. For example, here we convert the Birthday column to day month year, instead of year month day.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "birthdays['Birthday'] = birthdays['Birthday'].dt.strftime(\"%d-%m-%Y\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Treating ambigous date data\n",
    "\n",
    "However a common problem is having ambiguous dates with vague formats. For example, is this date value set in March or August? \n",
    "\n",
    "***Is ``2019-03-08`` in August or March?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately there's no clear cut way to spot this inconsistency or to treat it. Depending on the size of the dataset and suspected ambiguities, \n",
    "\n",
    "* We can either convert these dates to NAs and deal with them accordingly.\n",
    "* if you have additional context on the source of your data, you can probably infer the format\n",
    "* If the majority of subsequent or previous data is of one format, you can probably infer the format as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, it is essential to properly understand where your data comes from, before trying to treat it, as it will make making these decisions much easier."
