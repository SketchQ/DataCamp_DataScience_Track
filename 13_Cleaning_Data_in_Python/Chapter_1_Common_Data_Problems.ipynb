    "**In this Course **:\n",

    "* Diagnose dirty data\n",

    "\n",
    "| **DataType** | **Example** | **Python data type** |\n",
    "| -------------|-------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| Text Data | First name, last name, address ... | ``str`` |\n",
    "| Integers | # Subscribers, # products sold ... | ``int`` |\n",
    "| Decimals | Temperature, $ Exchange rates ... | ``float`` |\n",
    "| Binary | Is married, new customer, yes/no ... | ``bool`` |\n",

    "| Categories | Marriage status, gender ... | ``category`` |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### String to Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import CSV file and output header\n",
    "sales = pd.read_csv('sales.csv')\n",
    "sales.head(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures/saleshead.jpg' />\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the head of a Data Frame containing revenue generated and quentity of items sold for a sales order. We want to calculate the total revenue generated by all sales orders. As we can see, the Revenue column has the dollar sign on the right hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get data types of columns\n",
    "sales.dtypes    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures/datatypes.jpg' />\n",
    "\n",
    "A close inspection of the DataFrame column's data types using the ``.dtypes`` attribute returns object for the Revenue column.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also check the data types as well as the number of missing values per column in a DataFrame, by using the ``.info()`` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get DataFrame information\n",
    "sales.info()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Revenue column is a string, summing across all sales orders returns one large concatenated string containing each row's string. To fix this, we need to first remove the **$** sign from the string so that pandas is able to convert the strings into numbers without error. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Print sum of all Revenue column\n",
    "sales['Revenue'].sum()  # This will return all of the strings concatenated\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this with the ```.str.strip()``` method, while specifying the string we want to strip as an argument, which is in this case the *dollar sign*. Since our dollar values do not contain decimals, we then convert the Revenue column to an *integer* by using the ```.astype()``` method, specifying the desired data type as argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Remove $ from Revenue column\n",
    "sales['Revenue'] = sales['Revenue'].str.strip('$')\n",
    "sales['Revenue'] = sales['Revenue'].astype('int')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Had our revenue values been decimal, we would have converted the Revenue column to *float*. We can make sure that the Revenue column is now an integer by using the ```assert``` statement, which takes in a condition as input, as *returns nothing* if that condition is met, and an *error* if it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Verify that Revenue is now an integer\n",
    "assert sales['Revenue'].dtype == 'int'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric or Categorical?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common type of data seems numeric but actually represents categories with a finite set of possible categories. This is called **categorical data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "marriage_status\n",
    "3\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``0`` = Never Married ``1`` = Married ``2`` = Separated ``3`` = Divorced\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a marriage status column, which represented by 0, 1, 2, 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "However it will be imported of type integer, which could lead to misleading results when trying to extract some statistical summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this by using ``.astype()`` method seen earlier, but this time specifying the category data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Convert to categorical\n",
    "df[\"marriage_status\"] = df['marriage_status'].astype('category')\n",
    "```"

    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric data or ...?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, and throughout this chapter, you'll be working with bicycle ride sharing data in San Francisco called ```ride_sharing```. It contains information on the start and end stations, the trip duration, and some user information for a bike sharing service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```user_type``` column contains information on whether a user is taking a free ride and takes on the following values:\n",
    "* ``1`` for free riders.\n",
    "* ``2`` for pay per ride.\n",
    "- ``3`` for monthly subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, you will print the information of ```ride_sharing``` using ```.info()``` and see a firsthand example of how an incorrect data type can flaw your analysis of the dataset."
