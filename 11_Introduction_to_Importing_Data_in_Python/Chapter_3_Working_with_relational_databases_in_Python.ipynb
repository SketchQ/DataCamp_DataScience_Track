    "So what's a table? A table generally reprsents one entity type, such as **'Order'**. This table looks a great deal like a dataframe and that's the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In relational databases you do not merely have a bunch of tables, but that tables are **linked**. See that the **'Orders'** table has both column called ```'CustomerID'``` and ```'EmployeeeID'```. These columns correspond precisely to the primary keys in the **'Customers'** and **'Employees'** tables, respectively.\n",
