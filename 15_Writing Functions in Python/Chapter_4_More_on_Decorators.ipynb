    "### Time a function\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``timer()`` decorator runs the decorated function and then prints how long it took for the function to run. I usually wind up adding some version of this to all of my projects because it is a pretty easy way to figure out where your computational bottlenecks are. \n",
