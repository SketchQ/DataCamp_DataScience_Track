    "## Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you'll learn how to write functions that others can use. Docstrings are a Python best practice that will make your code much easier to use, read, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Complex Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def split_and_stack(df, new_names):\n",
    "        half = int(len(df.columns) / 2)\n",
    "        left = df.iloc[:, half]\n",

    "            columns=new_names\n",
    "        )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at this ``split_and_stack()`` function. If you wanted to understand what the function does, what the arguments are supposed to be, and what it returns, you would have to spend some time deciphering the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Complex function with a docstring\n",
    "\n",
    "With a docstring though, it is much easier to tell what the expected inputs and outputs should be, as well as what the function does. This makes it easier for you and other engineers to use your code in the future.\n",

    "### Anatomy of a Docstring\n",
    "\n",
    "A docstring is a string written as the first line of a function. Because docstrings usually span multiple lines, they are enclosed in triple quotes, Python's way of writing multi-line strings. Every docstring has some (although usually not all) of these five key pieces of information: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Description of what the function does.\n",
    "* Description of the arguments, if any.\n",
    "* Description of the return value, if any.\n",
    "* Description of errors that may occur, if any.\n",
    "* Optional extra notes or examples of usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docstring Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent style makes a project easier to read, and the Python community has evolved several standards for how to format your docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Google Style\n",
    "* Numpydoc\n",
    "* reStructuredText\n",
    "* Epytext\n",
    "\n",
    "Google-style and Numpydoc are the most popular formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google Style - description\n",
    "\n",
    "In Google style, the docstring starts with a concise description of what the function does. This should be in imperative language. For instance: \"Split the data frame and stack the columns\" instead of \"This function will split the data frame and stack the columns\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def function(arg_1, arg_2=42):\n",
    "        \"\"\" Description of what the function does. \n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google Style - arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes the *\"Args\"* section where you list each argument name, followed by its expected type in parentheses, and then what its role is in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "       def function(arg_1, arg_2=42):\n",
    "        \"\"\" Description of what the function does. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        Args:\n",
    "            arg_1 (str) : Description of arg_1 that can break onto the next line \n",
    "            if needed.\n",
    "            arg_2 (int, optional): write optional when argument has a default value.  \n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"\"\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need extra space, you can break to the next line and indent as I've done here. If an argument has a default value, mark it as \"optional\" when describing the type. If the function does not take any parameters, feel free to leave this section out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google Style - return value\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section is the \"Returns\" section, where you list the expected type or types of what gets returned. You can also provide some comment about what gets returned, but often the name of the function and the description will make this clear. Additional lines should not be indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        def function(arg_1, arg_2=42):\n",
    "            \"\"\" Description of what the function does. \n",

    "                if needed.\n",
    "                arg_2 (int, optional): write optional when argument has a default value.  \n",

    "            \"\"\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google Style - errors and extra notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if your function intentionally raises any errors, you should add a \"Raises\" section. You can also include any additional notes or examples of usage in free form text at the end.\n",
