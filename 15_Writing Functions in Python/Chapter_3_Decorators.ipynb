    "In this chapter, you are going to learn about decorators, a powerful way of modifying the behavior of functions. But first, we need to build up some foundational concepts that will make decorators easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing you should take away from this lesson is that functions are just like any other object in Python. They are not fundamentally different from lists, dictionaries, DataFrames, strings, integers, floats, modules, or anything else in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Objects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def x():\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    x = {'Foo': 42}\n",
    "    x = pandas.DataFrame()\n",
    "    x = 'Hello World'\n",
    "    x = 42\n",
    "    x = 3.14159265359\n",
    "    import x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions as Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "And because functions are just another type of object, you can do anything to or with them that you would do with any other kind of object. You can take a function and assign it to a variable, like ``\"x\"``. Then, if you wanted to, you could call ``x()`` instead of ``my_function()``. "

    "\n",
    "Note that setting x equal to 42 inside the function foo() doesn't change the value of x that we set earlier outside of the function.\n",

This is called the nonlocal scope to show that it is not the local scope of the child function and not the global scope.\n",

    "## Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know functions can be passed around as variables, and you understand scope and closures, we can talk about decorators.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a decorator? Let's say you have a function that takes some inputs and returns some outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decorator is a wrapper that you can place around a function that changes that function's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures/decorator.jpg' />\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify the inputs, modify the outputs, or even change the behavior of the function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does a decorator look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have seen decorators in Python before. When you use them, you type the ``\"@\"`` symbol followed by the decorator's name on the line directly above the function you are decorating.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    @double_args\n",
    "    def multiply(x, y):\n",
    "        return x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "    multiply(1, 5)\n",
    "    # Output: 20    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the ``\"double_args\"`` decorator modifies the behavior of the ``multiply()`` function. ``double_args`` is a decorator that multiplies every argument by two before passing them to the decorated function. So *1 times 5 becomes 2 times 10, which equals 20*. \n",
    "\n",
    "That seems kind of magical that we can alter the behavior of functions, so let's peel back the layers and see how it works. We will build the ``double_args`` decorator together in this lesson.`\n",
    "\n",
    "### The double_args decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue to use the ``multiply()`` function as the function we are decorating. Now, decorators are just functions that take a function as an argument and return a modified version of that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off, let's not have ``double_args`` modify anything. It just takes a function and immediately returns it\n",
    "\n",
    "If we call this version of ``double_args()`` that does nothing and pass it the multiply function and then assign the result to the variable ``\"new_multiply\"``, then we can call ``new_multiply(1, 5)`` and get the same value we would have gotten from ``multiply(1, 5)``."
