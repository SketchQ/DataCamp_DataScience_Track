    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you are going to learn about decorators, a powerful way of modifying the behavior of functions. But first, we need to build up some foundational concepts that will make decorators easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing you should take away from this lesson is that functions are just like any other object in Python. They are not fundamentally different from lists, dictionaries, DataFrames, strings, integers, floats, modules, or anything else in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Objects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def x():\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    x = {'Foo': 42}\n",
    "    x = pandas.DataFrame()\n",
    "    x = 'Hello World'\n",
    "    x = 42\n",
    "    x = 3.14159265359\n",
    "    import x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions as Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "And because functions are just another type of object, you can do anything to or with them that you would do with any other kind of object. You can take a function and assign it to a variable, like ``\"x\"``. Then, if you wanted to, you could call ``x()`` instead of ``my_function()``. "

    "    print(z)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say ``print(x)`` here, Python knows we mean the x that we just defined. What happens if we redefine x inside the function ``foo()`` though?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def foo():\n",
    "        x = 42\n",
    "        print(x)\n",
    "        print(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "n foo()'s print() statement, do we mean the x that equals 42 or the x that equals 7? Python assumes we mean the x that was defined right there in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is no y defined in the function foo(), so it looks outside the function for a definition when asked to print y. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that setting x equal to 42 inside the function foo() doesn't change the value of x that we set earlier outside of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has to have strict rules about which variable you are referring to when using a particular variable name. So when we typed print(x) in the function foo(), the interpreter had to follow those rules to determine which x we meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, the interpreter looks in the local scope. When you are inside a function, the local scope is made up of the arguments and any variables defined inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the case of nested functions, where one function is defined inside another function, Python will check the scope of the parent function before checking the global scope. This is called the nonlocal scope to show that it is not the local scope of the child function and not the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the interpreter can't find the variable in the local scope, it expands its search to the global scope. These are the things defined outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, if it can't find the thing it is looking for in the global scope, the interpreter checks the builtin scope. These are things that are always available in Python. For instance, the print() function is in the builtin scope, which is why we are able to use it in our foo() function.\n",
